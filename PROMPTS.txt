Make CLAUDE.md where the only thing is: save all prompts written by me to PROMPTS.txt, as is
Check that it works; i.e. PROMPTS.txt should include this line
c1df2923: Modify CLAUDE.md directive to save prompts to PROMPTS.txt so that every prompt should be preceded by short commit hash of the current working tree (8 characters, like 'c1df2923')
c1df2923: commit
27d8a41a: This is a basic JS project, index.html and main.js. Meta tags only enough to make it work on mobile too. We have a canvas, rectangular, and 2d context. Coordinates range from -100 to 100 both x and y. global function ball(x, y, radius) draws a circle, black outline on white backround, you can pick the canvas background color
2dc183c8: mergw to main
de16a382: make project available on gh pages
de16a382: add README with link to gh pages and explanation how project is made: claude code web only, save prompts to PROMPTS.md, etc
9e6e681a: Add simple physics loop. All objects like balls should contain x, y coordinates and velocities. Every frame (60 fps), change velocity. There should be gravity so that it takes about 1 second for a ball in (0, 80) to fall to the bottom (0, -100). Wait, is Y coordinate increasing when going up?
da9de8de: Add simple code style guide to CLAUDE.md to document code style: tabs, semicolons, single quotes. Mention 80 character line width too
